# Go Gin React

A sample project which uses Golang for backend and React for frontend.


On the backend side:

- Golang
- Gin framework


On the frontend side:

- React
- Vite


# Requirements

Beside `npm` and `Golang`, these tools need to be installed:

- [just](https://github.com/casey/just) to run the commands.
- [watchexec](https://github.com/watchexec/watchexec) to hot reload the backend.


They are useful for any kind of software development :)
